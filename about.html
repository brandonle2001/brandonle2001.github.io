    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is <strong>Brandon Le</strong>. I'm a student at Texas A&M University, Class of 2023. I am currently
        studying Management Information Systems and Cybersecurity at Mays Business School, as part of the Business Honors Program.
    </p>
    <p>Outside of class, I work as a Student Technician for the Engineering Studio for Advanced Instruction and Learning (eSAIL),
        a Department of the Texas A&M Engineering Expiriment Station (TEES) within the Texas A&M System.
    </p>
    <p>I love being involved on campus at Aggieland! I've worked with Student Government Association (SGA),
        the Memorial Student Center (MSC), and other events on campus. From Muster to Midnight Yell, I love the
        traditions at Texas A&M and am a diehard Aggie.

    <h1>My Academic Passions</h1>
    <ul style="text-align: left;">
        <li><b><u>Technology</u></b>: I enjoy learning about new innovations and changes in the technology industry.
        I'm not a hard coder, but I do enjoy creating programs that help me with small tasks (such as deleting duplicate images).
        I also enjoy learning about technology best practices, researching new tech like cloud computing, and more!</li>
        <li><b><u>Finance</u></b>: I am an avid stock enthusiast, despite not having the money nor time to actually invest.
        Many of my investments are purely in ETF's and Mutual Funds (groups of stocks, not individual stocks), and are
        for long term growth. But through my finance class (as well as self learning), I've been able to enjoy understanding
        market fluctuations, as well as stock performance indicators.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>My Fun Passions</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><b><u>Swimming</u></b>: I swam throughout high school, and while I'm not great at it, I do enjoy it from time to time.</li>
        <li><b><u>Spikeball</u></b>: You can find me time to time playing spikeball out on Simpson field!</li>
        <li><b><u>Traveling</u></b>: I love visiting new places with my girlfriend and family - I'm fortunate to have gone across
        the United States and across the world, trying to food (I'm a big fan of eating fancy/fun food) and seeing new sights</li>
        <li><b><u>My Pets</u></b>: I love taking care of me and my girlfriend's dogs, Midnight and Lexy, two little chihuahuas.
        You can find my Amazon wishlist full of dog toys and furniture.</li>
    </ul>
