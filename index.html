    <h1>Howdy!</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 16px;">I'm Brandon Le, a Management Information Systems student at Texas A&M Univeristy.
        <br><br>
        This website is a portfolio of projects and experiences I've had throughout my academic career,
        as well as a blog about things in life I am passionate about. At the end of the day, my hope is that
        this website can teach, inspire, or entertain others about the things I find interesting.
        <br><br>
        I enjoy learning and talking about about new technology and innnovations, finance (<em>stonks</em>), college and education,
        recruiting and internships, and a bunch of other, unrelated topics (pets, food, Texas A&M, Texas in general).

    <p>Throughout high school and college, I've been given the amazing privilege to serve and be a part of several amazing
        organizations which have helped build my learning and leadership. Above are only a few of them:</p>
